**RESPONSES TO QUERIES RELATING TO EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN**

**BACKGROUND**

A private U.S. company wants to offer shares to both its employees and consultants in the Philippines as part of its equity incentive program to retain and reward talent. The company specializes in providing consultancy services and building bespoke digital products. It contracts with software developers and other specialists (the consultants), makes those services available to its clients, and oversees consultant work. 

The equity incentive plan allows employees and consultants to use a portion of their earnings from the company to purchase company stock roughly every month at fair market value, as determined by a publicly-available formula established by the company. The company also lets them sell back their shares to the company or resell to accredited investors in regularly held online auctions conducted on a third-party platform. 

<u>The purpose of this questionnaire is to enable the company to design a process by which it can legally offer and sell its shares to citizens and residents of the Philippines as part of its equity incentive program and allow those individuals to resell their shares back to the company and/or to accredited investors without triggering registration requirements or other adverse consequences.</u> 

The company also would like to know about any required filings, fees, and risks.

When answering these questions, assume that consultants are not accredited investors.

**GENERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK**

#### **1. What are the key securities laws and regulations in the Philippines that govern the offering and sale of shares by a private U.S. company to its employees and consultants who are citizens or residents of the Philippines?**

The key securities laws and regulations in the Philippines that govern the offering and sale of shares by a private U.S. company to its employees and consultants who are citizens or residents of the Philippines are as follows:
<ol>
   <li>
   The Securities Regulation Code (SRC) – Republic Act No. 8799

   The SRC is the governing law for the sale, offering for sale or distribution of securities<sup>1</sup> within the Philippines, regardless of the relationship of the Parties to each other. It provides for the requirements of registration of securities (Section 8.1) as well as the exemptions from the requirements of registration (Section 10.1), among other . This SRC was signed in to law on 19 July 2020 and took effect on 8 August 2020.
   </li>
   <li>
    The Implementing Rules and Regulations of the SRC (IRR) – This provides a more details procedure in complying with the requirements of the SRC from registration, exempted transactions and regulatory compliance, among others. It was finalized on 2 April 2002 and has been amended several times, the latest being last 2015.<sup>2</sup> The latest IRR can be viewed at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website.<sup>3</sup>
   </li>
</ol>

The Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines (SEC) has been legally mandated and given specific powers and functions to administer and execute the provisions of the SRC.<sup>4</sup> This includes the development of and amendments in, when necessary, the IRR as well as the issuance of memorandum circulars and orders and opinions, among others, on particular matters relative to securities. 

#### **Other relevant laws and regulations that should be considered**

The key element for the application of the SRC and its IRR is that the offering and sale of securities is <u>made within the Philippines</u>.  
<ol start="3">
   <li>
   The Foreign Investments Act of 1991 (FIA) - Republic Act No. 7042

   This law governs the investment activities of a foreign (non-Philippine national) company within the Philippines. A private U.S. Company, not based in the Philippines, may still be considered to be doing business in the Philippines under the Foreign Investments Act of 1991<sup>5</sup> if it <u>solicits orders or service contracts</u> in the Philippines or does any other acts that imply a continuity of commercial dealings or arrangements.<sup>6</sup> Consequently, this would imply a sale or offering for sale of its securities to residents of the Philippines is made within the Philippines which can trigger the registration requirements in the SRC.
   </li>
   <li>
   SEC issuances – This relates to issuances of the SEC pursuant to its powers and functions provided under the SRC, among others. This includes, among others, the issuance of:
       <ol>
        <li type="a">
            memorandum circulars which provides guidelines, or policies in the implementation the SRC;
        </li>
        <li type="a">
            opinions on specific legal queries made by private persons or government body;
        </li>
        <li type="a">
            decisions or orders which it made after investigation on particular matters brought to it.
        </li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
   The National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines (NIRC) and issuances of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) – The NIRC provides the general law on the tax treatment of transactions done within the Philippines. The BIR is the government agency tasked to implement the NIRC and has the authority to issue regulations, circulars and other issuances to implement the provisions of the NIRC.
   </li>
</ol>

#### **2. Are there any distinctions in the securities laws of the Philippines between offering shares to employees versus consultants, particularly if consultants are independent contractors and not employees?**

While the SRC itself and its IRR does not make any clear and direct distinctions between offering shares to employees or consultants, the SEC will be guided by the following if the securities are to be offered as an option to either an employee or non-stockholder, where the consultant may be categorized:

- For employees officials who are not members of the board of directors, stock options may
be granted subject to a review of the scheme by the board and approval by the stockholders
in order to widen the corporate base and distribute corporate profits more equitably.<sup>7</sup>
- For non-stockholders, such as consultants, stock options may be granted if the board has
been authorized to grant that benefit by the corporation's articles of incorporation, by-laws
or by a resolution of the stockholders representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
outstanding voting and non-voting capital stock.<sup>8</sup>


The IRR has likewise defined an employee benefit plan<sup>9</sup> for purposes of disclosures and
preparation of registration statements and prospectus.<sup>10</sup>

Other Philippine laws such as the Labor Code of the Philippines<sup>11</sup> and National Internal Revenue
Code of the Philippines<sup>12</sup>, other tax laws, the Foreign Investments Act, the opinions of the SEC
should be considered as these laws will have different consequential applications if the buyer or
recipient of the securities is an employee or an independent contractor.

#### **3. Does the Philippines recognize the concept of "accredited investors" or an equivalent category of sophisticated investors, and if so, how is this defined under local law?**

Section 10.1(l) of the SRC enumerates the following as “qualified buyers”:

<ol type="i">
   <li>Bank;</li>
   <li>Registered investment house;</li>
   <li>Insurance company;</li>
   <li>Pension fund or retirement plan maintained by the Government of the Philippines or any political subdivision thereof or manage by a bank or other persons authorized by the Bangko Sentral to engage in trust functions;</li>
   <li>Investment company or;</li>
   <li>Such other person as the SEC may rule by determine as qualified buyers, on the basis of such factors as financial sophistication, net worth, knowledge, and experience in financial and business matters, or amount of assets under management.</li>
</ol>

Any sale of securities to the “qualified buyers” mentioned above are exempted from the
registration requirements of the SRC. Nonetheless, to avail of the said exemption, these qualified
buyers must first meet the conditions provided and comply with the requirements provided in Rule
10.1.11. of the IRR.<sup>13</sup>

The enumeration provided in the SRC is not exclusive as Section 10.1(10)(vi.) gives the SEC the
authority to determine other qualified buyers on the basis of such factors as financial
sophistication, net worth, knowledge, and experience in financial and business matters, or amount
of assets under management. 

**INITIAL OFFERING AND SALE TO EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS**

#### **4. Is it permissible under laws of the Philippines for a private U.S. company to offer and sell shares to its employees and consultants resident in the Philippines as part of an equity incentive program without registering the securities with a local regulatory authority?**

Yes, the IRR of SRC permits a foreign corporation, including a private U.S. company, to the offer
and sell its shares, in general, regardless if it is to employees or consultants, subject to the
observance of the conditions that the SRC, its IRR and the SEC has set forth. This includes, among
others, the filing requirements under the SEC,<sup>14</sup> necessary disclosures to the company stockholders,<sup>15</sup> the General Rules and Regulations for filing SEC forms,<sup>16</sup> as well as a statement whether the terms and conditions of the Plan in the Philippines are the same as that in other
jurisdictions and an undertaking that the optionees of the plan will have continuous access on the
key performance indicators of the company.<sup>17</sup>

The exempted transactions provided in the SRC are not specific to an equity incentive program
but if a private U.S. company intends to offer and sell shares to its employees and consultants who
are resident in the Philippines as part of an equity incentive program without registering the
securities with the SEC, it should ensure that it falls under any of the exempted transactions
provided in Section 10.1. and complies with the requirements provided in Rule 10.2 of the IRR.

#### **5. Are there specific exemptions available in the Philippines for offering shares to employees as part of an incentive plan (e.g., employee stock purchase plans), and what conditions must be met to qualify for such exemptions?**

The exemptions provided by the SRC are reflected in Section 10.1 and its specific requirements are provided for in the IRR. While it does not specifically include an employee incentive plan as part of the exempt transactions is Section 10.1, this list is not exclusive. The SRC gives the SEC the authority to determine other exempted transactions, if it finds that the requirements of registration under the SRC is not necessary in the public interest or for the protection of the investors such as by the reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering.
<sup>18</sup>

In any case, a private U.S. company may apply for a specific exemption following process
provided for in Rule 10.2 of the IRR. This includes the preparation and submission of the specific documents such as:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Letter-request which shall contain the following information<sup>19</sup>:<br/>
    a. Registered name of the applicant;<sup>20</sup><br/>

  </li>
  <li>Notarized certificate of the Corporate Secretary of the applicant Issuer attesting to the following<sup>26</sup>:<br/>
  a. Approval by the applicant's Board of Directors and required stockholders' approval of the stock offering plan ("the Plan");<sup>27</sup><br/>
  b. Genuineness and due execution of the Plan, a copy of which shall be attached to the certificate;<sup>28</sup> and<br/>
  c. If applicable, a breakdown of the number of shares earlier exempted from registration (citing SEC Resolution and date of approval), the shares subscribed by the optionees, and the remaining unissued shares computed on a year-to-year basis, and an explanation on why the applicant has renewed its application in spite of the availability of unissued shares.<sup>29</sup><br/>
  d. A Certification of the Human Resource Head or any position of equivalent nature that the optionee - employees were given a copy of the Plan to enable them to make an intelligent judgment on the advantages and disadvantages of the Plan.<sup>30</sup>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
   A listing of persons and their corresponding position(s) in whose favor such grant or issuance of options is to be made, indicating the number of shares to be given to each, or if this could not yet be ascertained, the formula to be used in determining such number of shares, and issue price.<sup>32</sup>
  </li>
  </ol>
  Together with the submission of the above, the following also must be observed:
  <ol type="a" start="5">
    <li>
    payment of a filing fee in an amount as prescribed by the SEC,<sup>33</sup>
    </li>
    <li>
    regular reporting on the issuance of shares to be made on or before the 10<sup>th</sup> of January of each year following the grant of the exemption until full issuance of the shares.<sup>34</sup>
    </li>
  </ol>

It must be noted that all documents executed abroad shall be in English and authenticated by the Philippine Embassy or Consulate where the documents were executed.<sup>35</sup>

The process mentioned here is in addition to the other applicable compliance requirements in the General Rules and Regulations for the filing of SEC forms<sup>36</sup> mentioned above.

#### **6. Do these exemptions extend to consultants who are not employees but provide services to the company, or are there separate exemptions or requirements for offering shares to independent contractors**

The exemption mentioned above are equally applicable to consultants provided that these transactions are within the limits of the SRC and the process of application for exemption is done in accordance with the IRR.

#### **7.Are there restrictions on the method of payment for shares (e.g., using a portion of earnings from the company), and do these restrictions differ for employees versus consultants?**

The SRC and its IRR currently does not provide any restrictions on the mode of payment of shares. There are however there could be different tax implications on the sale to employees and consultants.

#### **8. Are there limits on the number of employees or consultants who can participate in the equity incentive program or the total value of shares offered without triggering registration or other regulatory requirements?**

The SRC and its IRR does not specifically provide limits expressly for an equity incentive
program. However, should the sale of shares will be done to twenty (20) or more employees or
consultants, collectively, the sale will be need to comply with the registration requirements mandated by Section 8.1. of the SRC. It should be noted that while 10.1 (l) considers exempt the sale of securities to fewer than twenty (20), or not more than nineteen (19) persons in the Philippines during any twelve-month period an exempt transaction, the SRC likewise cautions that this exemption should not be used to evade compliance with the registration requirements of the SRC. <sup>37</sup>

#### **9. Are there any restrictions on Philippines residents receiving or holding shares in a foreign company?**

The SRC does not provide any restrictions on Philippine residents receiving or holding shares in a foreign company. A resident foreign company however will need to consider ownership restrictions provided for in the Foreign Investments Act of the Philippines<sup>38</sup> as well as the applicable tax treaties on income generated within the Philippines.

Likewise, a Philippine citizen also needs to consider the tax consequences that follow with receiving or holding shares of a foreign company, such as the reporting of income taxes, payment of capital gains and documentary stamp taxes, when applicable.

#### **RESALE OF SHARES BACK TO THE COMPANY OR TO ACCREDITED INVESTORS**

#### **10. Can employees and consultants legally resell their shares back to the company under the laws of the Philippines, and are there any conditions or restrictions (e.g., holding periods, approval processes) that apply?**

Yes, employees and consultants can legally resell their shares back to the company. While there are no express restrictions on the employees or consultants to resell their shares, the company, who is the issuer and buyer of the shares, is required to comply with Rule 19.4 of the IRR.<sup>39</sup>

Following said rule, the company can only repurchase its own shares if it has unrestricted retained earnings in its books to cover the amount of shares to be purchased<sup>40</sup> and is undertaking such repurchase for any of the following purposes:

<ol type="a">
  <li>To implement a stock option or stock purchase plan;<sup>41</sup></li>
  <li>To meet short-term obligations which can be settled by the re-issuance of the repurchased shares; <sup>42</sup></li>
  <li>To pay dissenting or withdrawing stockholders entitled to payment for their securities under the Corporation Code; <sup>43</sup> and</li>
  <li>Such other legitimate corporate purpose/s<sup>44</sup></li>
</ol>

Additionally, if the company intends to repurchase its shares through an active and widespread solicitation from the stockholders through publication, said publication shall only disclose the following:

<ol type="a">
  <li>The identity of the Issuer making the tender offer;<sup>45</sup></li>
  <li>The amount and class of securities being sought and the price being offered;<sup>46</sup></li>
  <li>The information required by SRC Rule 19.7; <sup>47</sup></li>
  <li>A statement of the purpose of the tender offer; <sup>48</sup> and</li>
  <li>The appropriate instruction for security holders on how to obtain promptly, at the expense of the Issuer making the tender offer, the information required in SRC Rule 19.7. <sup>49</sup></li>
</ol>

After the expiration of the tender offer for the repurchase of the shares, the SRC mandates the company to not make any further repurchases of shares which is the subject of the tender offer until ten (10) business days has lapse<sup>50</sup>.

#### **11. Is there a mechanism under the securities laws of the Philippines that allows employees and consultants to resell shares to accredited investors (or an equivalent category) either within the Philippines or outside the Philippines without triggering registration requirements for the resale?**

A sale of securities to qualified buyers<sup>51</sup> as defined under the SRC and its IRR is considered as an exempt transaction under Section 10.1(l). Nonetheless, the said sale still needs to comply with the notice of exemption.<sup>52</sup>

If the transaction i.e. the resale of shares of a private U.S. company, not doing business in the Philippines, is done outside the Philippines, the SRC and its IRR will not be applicable as these only applies to transactions made within the Philippines. There are however tax consequences that Filipino employees and consultants will have to observe once the resale of the shares have been executed.

The registration requirement for the sale or offer for sale of securities mandated by Section 8.1. of the SRC applies if it was made within the Philippines. This means that the registration requirement under the SRC will not apply if the sale or offer for sale is made outside the Philippines. 

#### **12. If consultants are not accredited investors, does this impact their ability to resell shares to accredited investors, and what steps must be taken to ensure compliance?**

The sale of securities by a consultants who are not accredited investors does not impact their ability to resell the shares to accredited investors, to ensure compliance, the sale or resale of securities by the consultant must fall under and of the exempt transactions under Section 10.1 of the SRC and should the consultant wants a confirmation that the intended sale or resale is an exempt transaction, he/she may submit an application for confirmation or declaration of exemption with the SEC using SEC Form 10.1.<sup>53</sup>

#### **13. Are online auctions conducted on a third-party platform permissible for share resales by individuals in the Philippines, and do such platforms need to be licensed or registered with a local authority when the platforms are based in the U.S.?**

The key element for the application of the SRC and its IRR is that the offering and sale of securities is made within the Philippines.<sup>54</sup> This means that if any of the activities done by third-party platform falls within the definition of the FIA as “doing business” in the Philippines, even if based in the U.S. the registration requirements of the SRC will apply. 

Currently there are no available SEC opinions that directly addresses online auction of shares through a third-party platform. However, in SEC Opinion 17-03 dated 4 April 2017, the SEC considered a non-Philippine based company to be doing business in the Philippines by using the twin characterization test.<sup>55</sup>

Nonetheless, to truly determine if a specific online auction requires or is exempted from registration in the Philippines, a SEC opinion may be obtained by the affected U.S. company that owns the said third-party platform.

#### **14. What are the holding period requirements, if any, before employees or consultants can resell their shares, either back to the company or to accredited investors?**

The SRC does not have any express conditions or restrictions (e.g., holding periods, approval processes) to employees or consultants before they can resell their shares, either back to the company or to accredited investors. 

#### **15. Are there restrictions on the volume or frequency of resales (e.g., limits on the percentage of shares sold in a given period) that apply to employees, consultants, or the company?**

Yes, under Rule 19.4.4 of the IRR of the SRC, an Issuer, i.e. the company in this case, shall not make any repurchase, otherwise than pursuant to the tender offer until the expiration of at least ten (10) days from the date of the termination of the tender offer of shares is the subject of the tender offer, or any security of the same class and series, or any right to repurchase such securities;<sup>56</sup> or if the shares being offered are pursuant to the exchange offer, or any security of the same class and series, or any right to repurchase any such security.<sup>57</sup>

The above-mentioned restriction however does not apply to repurchases which are calls or redemption of any security in accordance with the terms and conditions of its governing instruments;<sup>58</sup> or offers to repurchase securities evidenced by a certificate, order form or similar document which represents a fractional interest in a share of stock or similar security.<sup>59</sup>

#### **16. Are there any restrictions on reselling shares in a private foreign company in the Philippines?**

Under the SRC, there are no express restrictions on reselling shares in a private foreign company in the Philippines. But if the resale falls under any of the exempt transactions, the foreign company is required to include in its submissions, a statement whether the terms and conditions of the resale Plan in the Philippines are the same as that in other jurisdictions and an undertaking that the optionees of the plan will have continuous access on the key performance indicators of the company;

**FILINGS AND FEES**

#### **17. What filings, if any, must the company submit to regulatory authorities in the Philippines to offer shares to employees and consultants under this equity incentive program, and what are the associated fees?**

The SRC does not have specific filing requirements for an equity incentive program. But A
private U.S. based company, intending to sell or offer its shares (transaction) to its Philippinebased employees and consultants under its equity incentive program maybe considered to be a transaction within the Philippines and thus, covered by the requirement of registration under the SRC and its IRR applicable. Per Section 8 of the SRC, shares cannot be sold or offered for sale without a registration statement duly filed with and approved by the SEC unless said transaction can qualify as an exempt transaction in any of the circumstances provided in Section 10.1.

To comply with registration statement required in Section 8, a private U.S. based company shall:

- accomplish Form 12-1 

- pay a fee of not more than one-tenth (1/10) of one per centum (1%) of the maximum aggregate price at which such securities are proposed to be offered.

- Publish, at its own expense, a Notice of the filing of the registration statement in two
(2) newspapers of general circulation in the Philippines, once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks

If the transaction falls under any of the exempt transactions provided in Section 10.1, The SRC requires that a written disclosure to be provided to any party to whom it offers or sells securities, including employees and consultants, the disclosure shall contain, among others, the following information

- The specific provision of Section 10.1 of the Code on which the exemption from
registration is claimed;<sup>60</sup> and 


- The following statement in bold face:<sup>61</sup><br/>
  THE SECURITIES BEING OFFERED OR SOLD HEREIN HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UNDER THE SECURITIES REGULATION CODE. ANY FUTURE OFFER OR SALE OF THE SECURITIES IS SUBJECT TO THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CODE UNLESS SUCH OFFER OR SALE QUALIFIES AS AN EXEMPT TRANSACTION.


#### **18. Are there ongoing reporting obligations (e.g., annual reports, transaction notices) after the initial offering, and what are the deadlines and costs for these filings?**

    The grant of equity based compensation
    <ol>
      <li>
        No capital gains tax (CGT) will be imposed whether with or without an option price (which is, for the avoidance of doubt, different from the exercise price), since there is no realized capital gain on the part of the employer-grantor.
      </li>
      <li>
        No documentary stamp tax will be imposed.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The sale or transfer of the equity-based compensation will be treated as a sale, barter, or exchange of stocks not listed on the stock exchange and will have the following tax impositions:
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the sale of transfer is with consideration, a capital gains tax of 15% will be imposed on the net capital gains.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If a specific price was agreed for the sale of the shares, the difference between the sales price and the option price shall be subject to CGT.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the sale was granted without a price, the cost base of the option for purposes of computing the capital gains shall be zero. <sup>84</sup>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        If the sale or transfer is without consideration. It will be treated as a donation of shares of stock subject to Donor's Tax. The basis shall be the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the option at the time of the donation. 
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

There are no specific tax treatments on the grant of equity for consultants or non-employees.

In any of the cases above, the following taxes will also be imposed

<ol type="i">
  <li>
    a documentary stamp tax will be due on the actual issuance of the shares of stock at rate of 1% of the par value of shares if originally issued or 0.75% of the par value of shares for subsequent transfers.
  </li>
  <li>
    A withholding tax at a rate ranging from 5% to 35% depending on the employee’s compensation range. For consultants, an expanded withholding tax at a rate raging from 5% to 10% depending on the latter’s annual income.<sup>85</sup>
  </li>
</ol>

#### **22. Would the U.S. company have any Philippines tax reporting obligations for offering or selling equity to consultants in the Philippines or for facilitating the resale of equity?**

The tax reporting obligation of a U.S. based company will depend if the shares is considered sold within the Philippines as provided in the responses above or if the U.S. based company will be considered as ‘doing business in the Philippines’ and the sale of equity or its facilitation has resulted to an income generating activity within the Philippines. 

#### **23. How does the Philippines treat the resale of shares by employees or consultants for tax purposes, particularly if sold back to the company versus to accredited investors?**

The taxes for the resale of shares by an employee or a consultant whether sold back to the company or to accredited investors shall be the same.

#### **24. Could offering shares to consultants in the Philippines affect their classification as independent contractors under local employment or tax laws, potentially reclassifying them as employees?**

In the Philippines, the existence of an employer- employee relationship is based on two tests, 1) the four-fold test and the economic dependency test.<sup>86</sup>

Ther offering of shares to consultants in the Philippines does not in itself affect its classification as either an independent contractor or an employee and will depend on a number of factors but it could be considered as an evidence of payment of wages.

#### **25. Are there withholding or reporting obligations for the company related to taxes on the shares offered or resold by employees and consultants?**

Yes, there are withholding taxes due for any shares resold by employees and consultants that the company, as a withholding agent have to observe.

Compensation); and

Currently there are no mandatory employment benefits or protections that could be triggered by granting shares to consultants. 

#### **27. Would a consultant in the Philippines need to register the shareholding or report it to any authorities in the Philippines?**

#### **RISKS AND ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES**

#### **28. What are the primary legal risks or adverse consequences (e.g., fines, penalties, rescission rights) if the company fails to comply with the securities laws of the Philippines when offering or selling shares to employees and consultants?**

#### **32. Are there currency control or foreign exchange regulations in the Philippines that could complicate the purchase or resale of shares by employees and consultants using local currency?**

The following are some of the relevant enforcement actions by the SEC.

<ol type="1">

#### **37. How can the company structure the equity incentive program to minimize regulatory scrutiny while ensuring employees and consultants can resell shares to accredited investors?**

The specific structure will depend on a number of factors such as the number of employees or consultants that will be availing of the equity incentive program and needs to be made on a caseto-case basis

#### **38. Are there best practices or common structures used by companies in the Philippines for similar equity incentive programs that we should consider adopting?**

One of the best practices or common structures is to ensure that the sale of securities will fall under the exempt transactions which in turn could minimize the reportorial compliance of companies under the SRC. 

#### **CROSS-BORDER CONSIDERATIONS**

#### **39. Does the Philippines impose additional requirements or restrictions because the company is a U.S.-based entity offering shares to local residents, and how do these interact with U.S. securities laws (e.g., Regulation D)?**

The requirements or restrictions of the SRC is not imposed specifically to a U.S. based entity but
to all foreign companies in general. Moreover, there is no know interaction between the SRC and
U.S. Securities law but Section 66.5 of the SRC gives the SEC discretion to provide any submitted
to it to any foreign enforcement authority of any country whose laws grant reciprocal assistance to
the Philippines. <sup>96</sup>

#### **40. Are there any bilateral agreements or treaties between the Philippines and the U.S. that could affect the offering or resale of shares under this program?**
